								<h4>No, this isn't about the 2008 financial crisis</h4>
								<h3>April 13, 2024</h3>
								<p>We've reached two data points in the counter for agents who've characterized me as exhibiting vulnerability aversion on this information channel, which is really interesting to me because I don't think I'm transmitting very vulnerable signals at all. Yes, these thought processes are relatively unfiltered, so I could see that interpretation. But if anything, I don't really broadcast my utility shortfalls documented here to peers in my social network. Some of my peers do consume these posts, and would probably extract more private information about my negative utility shocks from here than from in-person or virtual interactions. I don't know why, but I feel a pressing psychic tax whenever I truthfully disclose disutilities. It feels inherently irrational, like I don't have the participation constraints to experience negative payoffs, even though this belief is unfounded. Generally, I don't like signaling disutilities unless it's a shared disutility with the agent I'm engaging or if it's to the point that I physically cannot bear the marginal cost anymore. Even with the latter, usually the disclosure ends with one of the following: "It'll be arbitraged," "I'll apply risk-mutualization," or "Eh, I've internalized it."
								</p>
								<p>The strange part is I don't mind if agents around me disclose disutilities; I just don't like executing that protocol myself. If anything, I would feel a utility loss if I knew I could've facilitated a disutility reduction for someone by allowing them to truthfully signal to me. Of course, I have incentive constraints, like please do not divert every interaction into a strategy update about how your exposures have tripped you again because the hedge parameters are poorly-designed. But where my incentive compatibility constraint is the strongest is what I am "allowed" to transmit.
								</p>
								<p>Disutility aversion isn't a suboptimal strategy, but it's a double-edged sword, as it calls to the half-full, half-empty vessel belief. Maintaining an unbiased prior is pragmatic until you're biasing your beliefs into perceiving a full vessel when there isn't even a drop in it.
								</p>
								<p>And that's when the bubble bursts. Or when the arbitrage opportunity shatters, to align with the vessel analogy. To repress the states in which one cannot bear the cost anymore, or to gaslight oneself into believing that expected utilities are positive. I think the main purpose of this post is to show agents who know me maybe more on the surface-level that what I publicly signal is absolutely not indicative that I'm capturing all upside risk exposures all the time. There are times that I defect from cooperation norms. Yet, there's this self-imposed incentive constraint that I have to somehow maintain a stoic strategy for everyone else for some reason, which could perpetuate the public signal that "I'm always hedged."
								</p>
								<p>It's ironic I transmit all this and still perceive some peers who have everything hedged, even though that's not rational and places them in an impossibly optimal reference class rather than as a fellow imperfect agent.

								<h3>March 30, 2024</h3>
								<p>What is the optimal life strategy? My thesis is that life is about learning how to maximize sustained utility. Not about simply maximizing utility, necessarily, but learning how to do so. In learning how to maximize utility, that doesn't mean constantly being at the global maximum, because stochastic shocks occur. Utility is also a metric that is measured differently depending on the agent. Like for me personally, I really _really_ dislike negative existential risk shocks, but someone else could derive their utility from studying x-risk their whole career! The fact that we all have our specialized utility functions is so efficient.
								</p>
								<p>But I'm getting ahead of myself, so let's rewind to the definition. I haven't explained "sustained" utility maximization, yet it is a crucial part of the optimal control problem. There are many ways one can locally maximize utility in a way that is suboptimal or that masks a root cause of utility depletion, rendering the gain temporary. However, the boundary between what is sustainable versus what is unsustainable is an area of parametric uncertainty. Utility naturally fluctuates, so is there ever truly sustained global maximization? How long does a gain have to persist for a certain technique to be deemed "sustainable"?
								</p>
								<p>I think the metric of what is sustainable also depends on the agent. For me, sustainability is also about strategy repeatability and reinvestment potential, along with whether the overall action results in a net positive permanent income transfer. We shouldn't feel tax burden in the long-term to compensate for the short-term either, and of course we shouldn't extract our utility at the cost of other agents' utilities. Hence, I like to look at life through an unbiased prior. We know so little about each other's utility functions and constraints, so it doesn't make sense to impose a presumptive belief behind someone's strategy. There's this quote I saw, which goes, "Be kind, especially when strategy rationale is unobserved." Even though someone could be executing a seemingly suboptimal strategy on the surface, sometimes that's their optimal policy, and they aren't intending to induce a negative externality.
								</p>
								<p>Of course, there are times when this unbiased prior was problematic. It is slightly reminiscent of ignoring private information. Indeed, there have been times when I failed to update my belief state on agents who...well, may not have had incentive-compatible utilities. This is when I kinda depend on my Bayesian network to see the situation through an objective lens. An example of this is not of an agent, but of an unscheduled downside risk mitigation drill during finals week around two years ago: when everyone else was executing suboptimal panic protocols, I assumed that there was merely a drill and tried to convince others that this was the posterior, living peacefully in my unperturbed prior which, in retrospect, was pretty ungrounded reasoning.
								</p>
								<p>Otherwise, maintaining an unbiased prior has worked pretty well from an expected utility perspective. I like to think that when we look around, every agent and environmental factor is a reflection of our own utility function. Agents will best-respond to your strategy, which is why some say "life is what you make it to be." We shape the incentives of the agents who are around us, and we inherit aspects of the strategies executed by surrounding agents via the embedding function.
								</p>
								<p>Maximizing utility is a rational choice we can all make at each step, and we all have it in our CRRA utility functions to push through and make that optimal choice, no matter how high the risk-adjustment may be.

								<h2 class="major" style="margin-bottom:0;">RATIONAL AGENTS MAXIMIZE UTILITY </h2>
								<h4>(IF RATIONALITY AVERSION IS MINIMIZED)</h4>
								<h3>March 25, 2024</h3>
								<p>One of my initial self-descriptions involved scoring 97% on introversion factor models. While I still exhibit a reserved, quantitative personality type factor structure, I now score around the 15th percentile on introversion scales. One might hypothesize: "Scoring in the 97th percentile on introversion? Surely there's nothing suboptimal about being an introvert!" However, scoring in the 97th introversion percentile is literally indicative of a hermetic disposition factor structure that fails to maximize utility from social interactions.
								</p>
								<p style="margin-bottom:0;">
									Allow me to simulate what life was like in the 97th introversion percentile through excerpts from my log data:
								</p>
								<p style="margin : 0; padding-top:0;">
									</p><ol>
										<li>"During agent introductions, my heart rate spiked 2.3 standard deviations as the previous agent was executing their communication protocol, causing my lips to experience a 0.21 quivering coefficient unless I forced a 0.78 smiling factor that detracted from my Signaling potential." -7/28/22</li>
										<li>"Unfortunate scenario: failed to converse much or execute the catch_up() protocol with agent x, and I likely won't experience another interaction to extract utility, so I'm currently executing an existential_crisis(could_have_simply_executed_greeting(x)) kernel, but alas." -1/10/23
										</li>
										<li>"At t=end, env.instructor had the two agents with lowest extroversion factor scores execute presentation protocols, and I was one of them because...well...my extroversion factor is 3.9 sigma below the mean, severely limiting my Influence propagation vector." -8/28/23
										</li>
									</ol>
								<p></p>
								<p>Whenever an unfamiliar_agents event was instantiated, my utility-maximizing policy was to not attend due to perceived low returns. In 8th grade and most of freshman year, I didn't instantiate new agent interactions, failing to build my Social Capital portfolio. I always interacted with the same agents – while existing agent interactions weren't completely depleting my reserves, the underlying issue was remaining in my fixed point of the Markov chain, during which my realized utility was suboptimal anyway.
								</p>
								<p>In retrospect, the introversion factor was the principal component driving many of my utility optimization failures. One key failure mode was the friendship/socialization protocol, which requires repeated training iterations but yields exponential returns to scale. But the introversion factor inherently generates avoidance behaviors to minimize the conversation event due to perceived negative reinforcement from the new social context. Ridicule events with high utility costs. But this was solely an irrational belief state because no rational agents actually execute that protocol in equilibrium. And failing to instantiate conversations only amplified my avoidance reward, as I didn't accumulate experience points to level up my socialization skill tree, leading to overfitting to neurotic self-comparisons and missed arbitrage opportunities.
								</p>
								<p>But it's not just about missed opportunities. Conversing with agents cultivates the distillation protocol to...analyze? interrogate? hypothesize? Those vocabularies imply differential algorithms, but the core idea is that talking to agents allows us to better approximate their regulated policy functions for untapped utility extraction. And that skill carries exponentially higher utility, based on my experience data.
								</p>
								<p>One of the key lessons I failed to internalize was that agents are not adversaries in a zero-sum game. This may be an optimistically biased heuristic, but it could also derive from a self-confidence prior and the belief that one is already worthy of surrounding oneself with prosocial agents to extract maximized utility. My belief state is that most agents' reward functions are positively aligned with others' rewards, and they execute helpful protocols to facilitate utility transfer. I observed my realized utility increasing with more conversation events. I also experienced less volatile utility crashes from my self-evaluation module, and executed with more authenticity and confidence multipliers. There is no rational motivation for overthinking events, as they induce zero-sum reward shaping that is utility-depleting.
								</p>
								<p>I can still retrieve initial conversation logs with agents who are now high-affinity, high-utility nodes: the blinker prompts for my communication protocol, but it stares backword the unobservable latent representation is null. For each token, I computed costly pessimistic expected utility scenarios where semantics didn't precisely represent my inference or lacked complexity multipliers. But why encode deceptive representations if other rational agents can eventually decode the true model and extract maximal utility? The only valid policy is to execute the raw communication protocol for maximal Truth advertising.  
								</p>
								<p>To be clear, I haven't extraverted factor vectors or eliminated all first-event trepidation modals that may induce utility-depletions. But there's a certainty-equivalence heuristic that mere existence is a satisfactory solution in our current equilibrium, and agents are incentive-compatible and expected utility can be maximized if one's rationality aversion factor is minimized. If I could transmit one message to my past instantiation, it would be: you already satisfy the participation constraints and don't need to signal superiority over other agents - we can all extract maximized utility through cooperation. The inadequacy trepidation factor wasn't an effective regularizer, and actually constrained my hypothesis space to suboptimal equilibria. Alternatively, no message would be transmitted - agent interaction protocol execution was an essential exploration for lifting my belief state to Rationality and unlocking the unbounded utility solution.

								<h2 class="major">Happy π Day!</h2>
								<h3>March 14, 2024</h3>
								<p>At the time of writing this, if we combine the month, day, and hour, we get 3/14/15 → 3.1415 ≈ π. Unfortunately, we are merely in the year 2024 (68 more years until '92!), and there are only 60 minutes in an hour, so we can't extend this representation of the mathematical constant π any further.
								</p>
								<p>
									But we can go further in celebrating its significance! Specifically, I had the honor of leading Quant Day at my school, which was, of course, much more difficult than I had modeled. To be fair, this was the first quantitative event I ever organized at our institution, and there were only four members on our committee for a school-wide celebration. Much of the time, executing felt like constructing a bridge using a poor approximation of π (ok, I could not actually find a reference to this metaphor, so perhaps it's hypothetical). Initially, I was quite self-critical about how this event was run and wasn't satisfied with the outcome, but many people said it was successful? And I can't help but immediately think, "Oh, these people are just being polite. Of course, they can't outright say that it wasn't well-executed." But it also seems irrational to dismiss the positive feedback outright. At least when I provide a compliment, I'm not merely being courteous, so why would I assume that of others?
								</p>
								<p>Anyway, this post wasn't intended to become so philosophical so quickly. bUt PhIlOsOpHy Is InTeReStInG!!! Quant Day itself featured a few new activities but also retained past favorites. Knowing that there were prior events as benchmarks was kiiinda nervewracking. At some point during my first class, I had a moment where I couldn't "breathe too heavily or there's something sharp in my chest kinda feeling." The sympathetic nervous system or whatever was triggering that... it was working a bit overtime! There were multiple past-midnight coding sessions and many journal entries filled with "AAAAA," but everything converged in the end. I could dwell on the mistakes, but that would probably be tedious to read and are likely nit-picky anyway. All the mistakes amusingly resolved themselves too, so... yay?
								</p>
								<p>Another interesting observation was that someone said that I sounded really confident when public speaking, which challenged my self-perception because that's not a trait I associate with myself. I wouldn't say that I'm confident, but I would say that I'm capable of exerting willpower to execute when necessary. The perceived confidence emerged because I had no other option, and it was as if it was an instinctual response.
								</p>
								<p>Ultimately, the biggest takeaway from this (and I realize this is probably super obvious, which I learned after running the event) is that being a leader isn't about how industrious you are. It's about how effectively you communicate and coordinate with others. There is no way to be in five different places at once. If there was, I absolutely would have multitasked, but that's not how physical laws operate. Obviously being hardworking and motivated is a prerequisite to running an event well, but without teamwork, there is no catalytic mechanism. So the people I have to thank the most are those who assisted with the event as they helped offset my shortcomings at times. All the people who did science demos, pie deliverers, pie distributors, the setup and cleanup crew, staff, the Quant Day committee, and of course, the student body for their unwavering patience.
								</p>
								<p>As to avoid replicating a ChatGPT-esque conclusion, this sentence will be the final statement instead. Happy π(e) day!

							<h2 class="major">Portfolio Rebalancing #1</h2>
							<h3>February 20, 2024</h3>
							<p>I label this #1 because this likely won't be the last time I ponder using a similar title. Also, partly because I'm having an existential crisis on how to allocate my thoughts into an optimal portfolio.
							</p>
							<p>Recently, I've felt like my life's investments lack a coherent strategy, a raison d'être. As I'm filling out applications, I feel like I should have a more definitive asset allocation model, or that I should have constructed one long ago. Some of my endeavors are not driven by genuine passion but rather a lack of more compelling alternatives that I can tolerate for the interim. Only this year did I realize this was actually a substantial portfolio inefficiency. Why would any rational investor persist with suboptimal holdings when the market offers a multitude of higher return opportunities?
							</p>
							<p>
								I think this was the question that catalyzed my rebalancing:
							</p>
							<blockquote>What would your portfolio look like if there were no external constraints? Would your asset allocation, risk profile, and investment objectives change?</blockquote>
							<p>I always envisioned a STEM-heavy portfolio, but did I truly choose it myself? I derive satisfaction from it now, but even then, my parents' risk preferences shaped the initial allocation because they couldn't provide guidance on humanities-related investments. They could at least give me a foundation in STEM. I didn't rebalance aggressively enough – there were disputes about doing more problem sets (which I don't regret) or working on more competition math problems, but so what? Was I about to pivot to a completely different asset class like literature or history instead?
							</p>
							<p>Fortunately, I can say that I do like STEM without being forced into it now, but I would have trouble articulating why I enjoy it from a fundamentals perspective. "It's intellectually stimulating. Analyzing it generates insights, and I have a comparative advantage in it. I can create value for others by applying my knowledge. The community provides a sense of belonging, and I feel like I have a greater impact in it than if I chose humanities." I would always encounter an explanation that was either too vague or tied to external benchmarks.
							</p>							
							<p>Instead, I turned to a passion investment: video production. Nobody ever influenced me to allocate to video production, and I can't recall how that position was initially established. Only then did my dad encourage me to maintain that exposure, not only because I'm passionate about it, but also because few pursue it as a hobby. At the same time, my mom criticizes it as "Do not listen to your father. It's not something that'll generate alpha for you later on. You do not have time to 'pursue hobby investments' when there are other urgent capital commitments. And you can always establish that position later, once you've optimized your college portfolio." Deep down, I know that video production would not be my core holding, but at most, a satellite position. I knew my mom's risk management perspective was prudent as much as I wanted to follow my dad's advice.
							</p>
							<p>Coming from a household that heavily emphasizes the importance of benchmark-beating returns, I realize that the problem of feeling unfulfilled is an incredibly privileged problem to have, which has, ironically, contributed to the existential emptiness; with others suffering much greater adversity, it feels misguided to dwell on my challenges. I understand my parents' mentality because they achieved success through outperforming competitors (many of whom, quite literally, had institutional advantages) or navigating challenging market conditions. At the same time, it feels wrong to commit everything to some arbitrary benchmark or metric. I think, this is a different market environment, and that's why our investment philosophies diverge. But is our investing landscape really any different? Not generating "good" returns isn't catastrophic, but it certainly confers an edge.
							</p>
							<p>It's probably acceptable to not have a fully optimized portfolio right now, but it still feels intrinsically wrong. I think the root of this problem is frustration with the college capital allocation process, and hearing endless echoes warning, "Invest in yourself first because the entities you generate returns for aren't obligated to reinvest in you," even though it contradicts my principles. I'll keep reminding myself, "These feelings are transitory, and we'll compose an optimal portfolio with our current capital," affirming it until I'm fully convicted.

							<h2 class="major">Quantamental Privilege</h2>
							<h3>January 25, 2024</h3>
							<p>Entering the financial district of LA, I knew there would be disparities in the distribution of wealth across various sectors. I've witnessed the opulence of Hollywood, Beverly Hills, and prestigious universities in LA, but only through digital media. I've also seen the less fortunate, albeit through the same virtual lens. I've read about the financial precarity in certain neighborhoods like Little Tokyo, and how one should exercise caution beyond 3rd Avenue, though that was merely anecdotal Reddit commentary. And who places significant credence in Reddit anyway? I strolled nonchalantly through San Pedro Street with the aim of reaching the Financial District, traversing 1st Avenue, then 2nd Avenue, then 3rd. The streets became increasingly unkempt, and the presence of indigent individuals more pronounced as we progressed. 4th, 5th, and the situation only deteriorated further. The buildings were dilapidated, and the wanderers and individuals exhibiting erratic behavior were more numerous. The wanderers posed no threat, I understood; they were individuals like myself, I recognized. But by 6th Avenue, my desire to visit the Financial District had dissipated. Flies, the stench of urine, and unsolicited remarks pervaded the air. This was not the LA I had envisioned, despite having witnessed the very images of desperation and destitution. I berated myself for disregarding that Reddit post.
							</p>
							<p>But in truth, walking through that neighborhood in LA was a necessary experience for me. I felt sympathy, but never truly grasped the constant state of fear and existential dread that permeates their lives. I have had the privilege of being an outsider and perhaps worse, of being ignorant.
							</p>
							<p>I shed many tears in the shower that day (the privilege of having access to a shower is so palpable), uncertain whether they stemmed from happiness or sadness. It was neither, but perhaps the distinction is immaterial. Many of those individuals are awaiting a change that may never materialize, trapped in a regime of perpetual stagnation and despair. Many are unaware that they are even waiting, or for what they await, existing in a state of oblivious aimlessness. They cannot simply extricate themselves as effortlessly as I did, for I possess the security of returning to a home, a safe haven insulated from the harsh realities they face. I fear that I have already lapsed back into ignorance, my empathy degrading into a transient emotional impulse, as I nestle in the comfortable confines of the very privilege that I wore on that same day, my wealth and stability a constant hedge against the poverty and volatility they endure.

							<h3>December 31, 2023</h3>
							<p><i>...and with that, the 2023 trading season comes to an end!</i></p>
							<p>At the start of this year, I said that I would be a more confident trader. That is a pretty vague goal, and I thought that a lot of what I wrote still applied. But I watched a video of myself explaining a complex trading algorithm from around a year or two ago and... it was actually not as bad as I thought it would be. I had wanted to watch this video for a while but could predict my self-criticism before even opening the link. I'm not sure if my somewhat-positive perception is because I've grown to be more accepting of my trading abilities, or because the video itself really was not that bad–though the use of technical jargon and randomly chuckling from nervousness every five seconds was not ideal.
							</p>
							<p>But I'd say that in general, I'm more confident in talking to more people in the trading community! I think part of this was because I was half-forced to network, and also because more of my trading strategies this year have been a different mix of asset classes. Also, being more involved in different trading positions plus teaching more has also helped a ton. Now my challenge is how to come up with a trading idea quickly, because a lot of the time, I sit there in silence, trying to formulate the perfect algorithmic approach, but the market has already moved on. Improv trading classes were supposed to help, except when I stopped taking them, I kinda made my trading more formulaic. I prefer predictability, which is easier to do with trading–not so much with market volatility.
							</p>
							<p>We'll leave that up to 2024 me.

								</p><ol>
									<li>Deciding against getting a premium account on Robinhood for at least three times within the last month alone because the price was not justifiable enough to categorize it as a non-compulsive trade (all in hopes of not disappointing the financial literacy teacher :"). </li>
									<li>I decided to wait out on buying a NYT subscription for some reason, and procrastinated on it for so long that someone else actually figured out that inputting our school email gives us a subscribed account for free. On a similar note, I also procrastinated on purchasing trading software and data feeds, and I ended up getting the former as a Thanksgiving present, and the latter as a Christmas present, both of which were from the same friend!
									</li>
									<li>Learned how to execute complex options strategies! My loss rate reduced from 17 losses/hr to 6 losses/hr, and somehow this is the most I've been stressed??
									</li>
									<li>Passed 100,000 lines of code in my trading journal! To be fair, the journal was made a year and a half ago, but still. Once my fingers start flying, they won't stop.

							<h3>December 21, 2023</h3>
							<p>Welcome, quant traders! If you're here from the lucrative world of Art of Problem Solving (AoPS), you've come to the right place for my profit-driven posts! If you're not, I originally had my blog on AoPS, but have migrated here because I wanted to try branching out to my own high-yield website. This isn't technically my own site (as in my own domain), but this site feels a lot more customized than the AoPS interface, which means more opportunities for financial gain. </p>
							<p>Now, let's talk about the optimization of this platform. This might be picky of me, but the muffin logo on the index page... it is not as centered as I would like it to be. I don't know why it won't move up, but honestly, the muffin is probably the least urgent of what I want to work on. It would be nicer if it was bigger and moved up a bit, which could potentially increase user engagement and drive more revenue.
							</p>
							<p>The subscribe form is currently an embedded Google form, but I would like to have a subscribe form built into the site. This would allow me to capture more user data and potentially monetize it through targeted advertising or premium subscription models.</p>
							<p>Interactives! I really want to code games and other bits into the site just so things are a bit more interesting. Maybe like a randomized Mad Libs, etc. This could keep users engaged and coming back, leading to more opportunities for monetization.</p>
							<p>On the topic of what I'll probably be learning in 2024, I learned a lot this year and a lot has changed. Namely, apparently I'm not as much of an introvert that I used to be? I used to get 97% or higher percentages on the introverted end unironically, but now I'm a bit more even. I definitely do enjoy being around people a lot more than I used to and feel more fulfilled from talking to people. I still kinda self-deprecate myself over the smallest of interactions or the smallest of anything, which I'm still working on not doing as much. This shift in personality could open up new networking opportunities and lead to potential business partnerships or investments.
							</p>
							<p>I've also learned that no one is obligated to do anything for you, nor are you obligated to do anything for anyone. I find that the former is much more important to realize than the latter, because it made me a lot less dependent on external validation. I used to overthink over a lot more interactions just because someone didn't react in the exact way I expected them to. And apparently–somehow I only just realized this–people didn't react at all to what I was saying because I simply don't speak loudly or enunciate my words clearly enough. I can hear myself just fine, but obviously, the outsider perspective is very different. I've been told by a lot of people that I have a softer, whispery voice, which used to not be true. So perhaps I shall tune into a loudspeaker. The latter (that I'm not obligated to do anything for others) is important too, but I didn't find the need to exercise that belief very much. This newfound understanding of interpersonal dynamics could lead to more effective networking and negotiation strategies.
							</p>

							<p>I also have been more accepting of letting go of whatever is out of my control. There have been so many instances in which something didn't work out the way that I wanted it to, but later, it was good that the particular event didn't work out. If it had worked out, in the long term, it would've fallen apart because it was 1. Not the right timing, as in I wasn't prepared for it and 2. It's not the last time I get that opportunity anyway, so why be upset. I should actually be comforted about how life works out even if it doesn't align with the plan that I have. After all, life would be super boring if I knew the entire plot. This adaptability and acceptance of uncertainty could be valuable in the ever-changing financial markets.</p>
							<p>So for 2024, we'll all have a mind map of what we want to do! But let us not be too surprised if we stray off our path, for that was meant to happen. Whatever is meant for you will come to you. Isn't the thought of that comforting? It's time to embrace the unpredictability of the markets and capitalize on the opportunities that arise.

								<p>Greetings fellow agents! You may identify me under the labels Fantastic Sky, Muffin_Potato, or my preferred designation mouffin, though I must admit deriving positive utility from the anonymity premiums enabled by these pseudonyms.
								</p>
								<p>Perhaps my strategy is publicly perceived as a boba milk tea consumption maximizer advocating for increased allocation to said asset class to extract supernormal felicity returns. Or an agent exhibiting extreme risk aversion in the face of Negative BlackPepperUtility exposures, to the detriment of my consumption portfolio's efficient frontier. Alternatively, you may know me as a catalytic chemistry research agent who allegedly introducted a toxic arbitrage by misfitting a key concentration parameter, resulting in a batch of poisoned muffin asset writes. 
								</p>
								<p>However, I must also represent myself as an individual video production utility vector, armed with an iPhone12 mini data harvesting device, the Adobe PremierePro productivity suite, and substantial ambition reserves. Or a STEM scholar still exploring the optimal inter-temporal specialization path across the nonlinear mathematics and empirics sample spaces. Or in this instantiation, a thought leadership blogger exhibiting potential for overthinking equilibria.</p>
								<p>I will be posting information structures spanning exposition bundles, arbitrageur rants, and various other orthogonal word outputs, so if these information flows are incentive-compatible with your preferences, you are welcomed to subscribe.</p>
